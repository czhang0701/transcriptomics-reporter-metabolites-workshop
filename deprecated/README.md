# Deprecated Files

## ⚠️ This folder contains OUTDATED documentation

These files were created during the workshop development process but have been **superseded** by the final workshop design.

---

## Why These Files Are Deprecated

During development, the workshop approach changed based on user feedback:

**Initial Approach** (Outdated):
- Students install R/packages BEFORE workshop
- Workshop focuses only on analysis
- Separate documents for different aspects

**Final Approach** (Current):
- Students install R/packages DURING workshop (first 30 min)
- Everything in ONE comprehensive guide
- Installation happens with instructor help available

---

## ❌ DO NOT USE These Files

The following files in this folder contain **incorrect information** about the workshop format:

### **PRE_WORKSHOP_SETUP.md**
- Assumes students install before workshop
- **Wrong**: Installation is now DURING workshop
- **Use instead**: WORKSHOP_GUIDE_COMPLETE.md (Installation Section)

### **WORKSHOP_SCHEDULE_3HR.md**
- References pre-workshop installation
- Timeline is mostly correct but approach is outdated
- **Use instead**: WORKSHOP_GUIDE_COMPLETE.md (Timeline Section)

### **FINAL_SUMMARY_3HR.md**
- Contains email templates for pre-workshop setup
- Contradicts final workshop design
- **Use instead**: WORKSHOP_GUIDE_COMPLETE.md

### **INSTALLATION.md**
- Standalone installation guide
- Now integrated into main workshop guide
- **Use instead**: WORKSHOP_GUIDE_COMPLETE.md (Installation Section)

### **QUICK_START.md**
- Outdated quick reference

- **Use instead**: README.md

### **GITHUB_READY.md** & **READY_FOR_GITHUB.md**
- Internal preparation documents

### **CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md** (Added Dec 2025)
- Internal documentation of past cleanup operations
- Task completed, archived for reference
- No longer needed for workshop delivery

### **REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md** (Added Dec 2025)
- Outdated structure documentation (references wrong module numbers)
- Superseded by current README.md
- Module numbering changed: Reporter Metabolites moved to Module 3

### **TODO_DOCUMENTATION.md** (Added Dec 2025)

## 📝 Why We Keep These Files

These files are preserved for:
1. **Historical reference** - Shows workshop development process
2. **Learning from mistakes** - Documents what didn't work
3. **Version control** - Complete project history
4. **Attribution** - Acknowledges all work done

However, **DO NOT use them for the actual workshop!**

0:50-1:05 (15m)  Module 2: GSEA (PIANO)
1:05-1:15 (10m)  BREAK
1:15-2:15 (60m)  Module 3: Reporter Metabolites ⭐ MAIN GOAL
