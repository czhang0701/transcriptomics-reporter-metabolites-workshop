## 📋 Pre-Workshop Communication Plan

### **2 Weeks Before Workshop**

Send students email with:

**Subject**: "Workshop Pre-Setup Required - Complete by [DATE]"

**Email Content**:
```
Dear Workshop Participants,

Welcome to the Transcriptomics to Reporter Metabolites workshop!

IMPORTANT: Please complete the following BEFORE the workshop:

1. READ: PRE_WORKSHOP_SETUP.md (attached)
2. INSTALL: R, RStudio, and all packages (45-60 min)
3. VERIFY: Run verification script
4. DEADLINE: Complete by [DATE - 24h before workshop]

Why? Package installation takes 20-30 minutes. Our workshop is only 3 hours,
and we need that time for analysis, not installation!

Platform Support:
- Windows users: See pages 2-5 of setup guide
- Mac users: See pages 6-10 of setup guide
- Both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs supported

Having issues? Email me at [email] at least 48 hours before workshop.

See you soon!
