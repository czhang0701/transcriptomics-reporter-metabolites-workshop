## 🎓 Teaching Tips

### General Approach

1. **Live Coding**:
   - Type code in real-time (don't copy-paste)
   - Explain each line as you type
   - Make intentional mistakes to show debugging
   - Use RStudio shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter, etc.)

2. **Interactive Questions**:
   - Pause every 10-15 minutes for questions
   - Use "raise hand" feature (virtual) or ask verbally
   - Cold call occasionally to check understanding
   - Encourage peer-to-peer explanations

3. **Pacing**:
   - Check completion status regularly
   - Have "stretch goals" for fast learners
   - Prepare abbreviated versions if running behind
   - Build in buffer time

4. **Engagement**:
   - Use polls/quizzes between modules
   - Encourage hypothesis generation before revealing results
   - Ask participants to predict outputs
   - Share real-world examples

## 🔧 Common Technical Issues

### Issue 1: Packages Won't Install

**Cause**: Outdated R version or missing system libraries

**Solution**:
```r
# Check R version
R.version.string

# Update Bioconductor
BiocManager::install(version = "3.18")

# Install system deps (Linux)
# Show in Terminal, not R:
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev
```

**Prevention**: Emphasize minimum R version in pre-workshop email

---

### Issue 2: Data Files Not Found

**Cause**: Working directory not set correctly

**Solution**:
```r
# Show current directory
getwd()

# Set directory (adjust path)
setwd("path/to/workshop_materials")

# Check files are there
list.files()
```

**Prevention**: Include directory setup in Module 1 introduction

---

### Issue 3: MOFA2 Python Issues

**Cause**: Python not installed or not detected

**Solution**:
```r
# Use R-only mode
library(MOFA2)
# When running model:
model <- run_mofa(model, use_basilisk = TRUE)
```

**Prevention**: Mention Python is optional in installation guide

---

### Issue 4: Out of Memory Errors

**Cause**: Large dataset + limited RAM

**Solution**:
```r
# Use fewer features
top_var <- head(order(-apply(data, 1, var)), 1000)
data_subset <- data[top_var, ]

# Increase memory (Windows)
memory.limit(16000)
```

**Prevention**: Pre-filter datasets to manageable sizes

---

### Issue 5: Slow MOFA2 Training

**Cause**: Too many iterations or factors

**Solution**:
```r
# Reduce iterations for demo
training_opts <- get_default_training_options(model)
training_opts$maxiter <- 500  # Instead of 1000

# Reduce initial factors
model_opts <- get_default_model_options(model)
model_opts$num_factors <- 10  # Instead of 15
```

**Prevention**: Use pre-trained models for demonstration

---

## 📊 Key Discussion Points

### Module 1: Differential Expression

**Questions to Ask**:
- "Why do we use raw counts instead of FPKM for DESeq2?"
- "What does a negative log2FoldChange mean in our contrast?"
- "Why is padj more important than pvalue?"

**Common Confusion**:
- Direction of fold change (Late vs Early)
- Interpretation of NA values in results
- When to use lfcThreshold

---

### Module 5: MOFA2 Introduction

**Questions to Ask**:
- "How is MOFA2 different from running PCA on each omics separately?"
- "What would a factor active in mRNA but not protein suggest biologically?"
- "When would you NOT want to use MOFA2?"

**Common Confusion**:
- Difference between factors and principal components
- Why factors can be omics-specific
- How to determine optimal number of factors

## ✏️ Exercise Solutions Strategy

### During Workshop

**Option 1**: Give 5-10 minutes for exercises, then solve together
- Pro: Everyone learns the solution
- Con: Slower learners may not attempt

**Option 2**: Provide solutions file, work independently
- Pro: Self-paced learning
- Con: Less interactive

**Option 3**: Break into groups, share solutions
- Pro: Peer learning
- Con: Requires more time

**Recommended**: Combination approach
- Quick exercises: Solve together
- Longer exercises: Independent + group discussion

---

## 📝 Assessment Options

### Formative Assessment (During Workshop)

1. **Quick Polls**:
   - "Which genes are up-regulated in Late stage? A) LFC > 0, B) LFC < 0"
   - "How many omics layers does MOFA2 require? A) 1, B) 2+, C) 3+"

2. **Code Prediction**:
   - "What will this code output?"
   - "Will this plot show up-regulated or down-regulated genes?"

3. **Debugging Exercises**:
   - Provide code with intentional errors
   - Ask participants to find and fix

### Summative Assessment (Post-Workshop)

1. **Take-Home Assignment**:
   - Analyze new dataset with same workflow
   - Submit R script + interpretation
   - Due 1 week after workshop

2. **Short Quiz**:
   - 10 multiple choice questions
   - Covers key concepts from all modules

3. **Project Proposal**:
   - Design multi-omics experiment
   - Describe analysis plan using workshop methods

## 🔄 Iterative Improvement

### After Each Workshop

1. **Collect Feedback**:
   - Send post-workshop survey
   - Ask about pace, clarity, usefulness
   - Request suggestions for improvement

2. **Review Common Issues**:
   - Note which concepts were confusing
   - Identify technical problems
   - Update materials accordingly

3. **Update Materials**:
   - Fix errors in tutorials
   - Add clarifications based on questions
   - Update package versions if needed
